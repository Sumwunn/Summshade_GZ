# Summshade_GZ (GZDoom/Zandronum/Others)

- Older versions

- v1-v3 were minor revisions to make the preset less jarring on skies.
- v4 is tweaks and includes Adaptive Tonemapper. My 2nd favourite.
- v5 is my favourite since it's the most performance friendly and doesn't blow out whites too much and isn't too dark. It also includes a tweaked CRT Shader. ~~Sadly, though, it doesn't work on OpenGL (vort_hdr compile error)~~.
- v6 switched shaders for use on OpenGL. It's visually similar to v5 and marginally more demanding.
- v5b: I discovered vort_hdr works again on OpenGL. It's a revised v5, with tweaks to bloom, saturation, and others. Glamayre_Fast_Effects depth effects are tweaked to make clipping less noticeable (disabled by default). If you enable it, I recommend enabling depth for flashlight, too.
